**Index Ratings for Popular Programming Languages from TIOBE**

![TIOBE Logo](https://i.ibb.co/J2JCXXF/tiobe-logo.png)

TIOBE Index Rating (more formally, TIOBE Programming Community Index) is an indicator for measurement of the programming languages' popularity. It gets updated every month once (although the dates are not regular). 

The ratings are based on the number of engineers world-wide, courses and 3rd party vendors. To calculate the ratings, 25 search engines (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Baidu) are also used. In order to qualify a language, it must have its own Wikipedia entry; the explanations must be stated clearly for being a programming language. Furthermore, it should be "Turing complete" and have at least 5000 hits for "language programming" for Google.
  
According to the authorities, this index is NOT an indication for the best programming language. Rather, it is a helpful measurement to choose the language strategically for software development.

## Source

All the datasets presented here are taken from this web site. Click the link for more information: https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/

## Datasets

There are **two** main types of datasets available: 

The **first type** contains all the ratings for popular programming languages, starting from June 2001. Surely, new lines are inserted when a new index rating is published monthly. Other languages might be added later as inidividual columns once they've made to the top 20.

The **second type** shows the ratings for top 20 programming languages that were presented to the monthly index list. Here, the ratings between **September 2020** and **July 2023** are available individually, and new ones will exist as separate datasets in monthly basis. After some time, the lists from the previous years are grouped together in their belonging directories. 

All rating values are carefully fetched by examining the graphical plots of all aforementioned programming languages.

Furthermore, there exist sub-types in this repo: **Very Long Term History** which contains the rankings of popular programming languages according to the index as 5-year intervals (from current year down to 1988) and **Programming Language of the Year** that represents the list of programming languages entered the hall of fame by having the highest rise in ratings every year, since 2003.

## Analyses

Currently, there are two analyeses available: **January 2023** & **November 2020**. 

Click on the corresponding IPython files above to inspect and see how the ratings for many programming languages have been changed within two years: **Tiobe_Index_Ratings_(Jan2023).ipynb** or **Tiobe_Index_Ratings_(Nov2020).ipynb**.
