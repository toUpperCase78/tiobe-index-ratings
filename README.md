**Index Ratings for Popular Programming Languages from TIOBE**

![TIOBE Logo](https://i.ibb.co/J2JCXXF/tiobe-logo.png)

## Description

TIOBE Index Rating (more formally, TIOBE Programming Community Index) is an indicator for measurement of the programming languages' popularity. It gets updated every month once (although the dates are not regular). 

The ratings are based on the number of engineers world-wide, courses and 3rd party vendors. To calculate the ratings, 25 search engines (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Baidu) are also used. In order to qualify a language, it must have its own Wikipedia entry; the explanations must be stated clearly for being a programming language. Furthermore, it should be "Turing complete" and have at least 5000 hits for "<language> programming" for Google.
  
According to the authorities, this index is NOT an indication for the best programming language. Rather, it is a helpful measurement to choose the language strategically for software development.

## Datasets

There are **two** types of datasets available: 

The **first type** contains all the ratings for popular programming languages, starting from June 2001. Surely, new lines are inserted when a new index rating is published monthly. Other languages might be added later as inidividual columns once they've made to the top 20.

The **second type** shows the ratings for top 20 programming languages that were presented to the monthly index list. Here, the ratings between **September 2020** and **November 2021** are available individually, and new ones will exist as separate datasets in monthly basis.

All rating values are carefully fetched by examining the graphical plots of all aforementioned programming languages.

## Analyses

The first analyses are available for **November 2020**.

_Newer analyses will be on the way in 2022, and still in my to-do list!_
